        {`Hello! I’m Lori, a web development student who loves building responsive, user-friendly websites. I have a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with experience in React, TypeScript, and recently, SQL. My journey into web development began with a fascination for technology and a desire to create things that people can interact with daily. As I continue to learn, I’ve found a real enjoyment in working with SQL to manage and interact with data effectively. Now, I'm passionate about writing clean, efficient code and crafting seamless user experiences.`}

        {`When I'm not coding, you’ll probably find me at a Kesha concert, sketching doodles for my brand Hazydoodlez, or playing with my cat, Roy. I'm always eager to learn new skills, tackle creative challenges, and bring ideas to life through technology. Let's connect and see how we can make something great together!`}
